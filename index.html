        <h3>Functional Music to Improve</h3>  
        <h2>Focus in 15 Minutes</h2>  
        <p>Our science-first approach creates music that sounds-and affects your brain differently-than any other music.</p>

            <h3>Patented Technology</h3>
            <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating function music, including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking</strong>-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
            <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

            <h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
            <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run</p>
            <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
            <p><strong>Our experiments always include a control condition ("placebo") </strong>of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
